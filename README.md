# Emoji Game 🎮

## Description
Welcome to the **Emoji Game** 🕹️, a fun and interactive game built using **React** where players have to click on emojis without repeating them. The objective is simple: click all the emojis exactly once. Every time you click an emoji, your score increases by 1. If you click an emoji you've clicked before, you lose the game. If you manage to click every emoji without repeating any, you win the game! 🎉

This game includes features like score tracking, top score keeping, dynamic shuffling of emojis, and a reset functionality, offering a fun challenge each time you play. With the use of React’s state management and conditional rendering, the game is built to deliver a smooth and engaging experience. 😄

## Features ✨
- **Score Tracking**: For each unique emoji clicked, your score increases by 1. 🏆
- **Top Score Tracking**: The highest score from previous games is saved and displayed. 📊
- **Emoji Shuffling**: Emojis are shuffled randomly after each click to add a fun and unpredictable challenge. 🔄
- **Win Condition**: Clicking all emojis without repeating them results in a win. 🏅
- **Lose Condition**: Clicking an emoji more than once causes a game over. 💥
- **Play Again**: After the game ends (win or lose), the option to play again is available, resetting the score but preserving the top score. 🔁

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **React** - The JavaScript library for building the user interface. ⚛️
- **CSS** - For styling the game interface and creating responsive layouts. 🎨
- **JavaScript** - For handling game logic, including score tracking and emoji shuffling. 🖥️
